# Fluid Standalone Rendering Engine

As a designer/integrator, this package allows you to easily render templates and partials before their actual
integration into a full-blown TYPO3 website.

This is especially useful when the designer team works on template files (HTML/CSS/JS) and provide ready-to-use
assets to the TYPO3 integration team.  


## Installation

1. Include as composer dependency using `composer require causal/fluid-standalone-renderer`
2. Run `composer install` to generate the vendor class autoloader
